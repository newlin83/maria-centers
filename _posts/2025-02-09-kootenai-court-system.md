description: The corruption of the family law system in Kootenai County Idaho

> Corruption is not confined to the halls of justice; it seeps into every hand that feeds it, every voice that defends it, and every system that enables it. The rot is not in the tree alone, but in the roots and the soil that sustain it.

This is a criticism of the entire family law system in Kootenai County. This is a criticism of:

- Kootenai County Magistrate Court
- Idaho Department of Health and Welfare
- Mediation
- Family Court Service Office (supervised visitation, parenting class)
- Kootenai County Sheriff & Coeur d'Alene Police Department
- "Best Interest Standard"
- Pediatricians and social workers

These are topics I want to add later:

- Judges
- Attorneys and Idaho Bar

- Women's shelters (e.g. Safe Passage)
- Child Support Enforcement

I have no experience with custody evaluators and GALs, so I won't comment on them, beyond saying that I've heard these people are just as corrupt as everyone else, and absolutely are not looking out for children. Some of these GALs are the same people that I'm criticizing elsewhere. They simply use the system to make money and to protect people based on their on biases and prejudices.

Ultimately, this is the fault of the government for having such a corrupt system that does nothing but harm children and good parents, while lining their own pockets, abusing power, and attacking those who try to hold this system accountable.
