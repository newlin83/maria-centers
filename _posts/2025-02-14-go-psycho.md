Maria gave her sister a car and a large amount of money for her sister to try and get sole custody with no visitation for the father of Kathleen's children (#2 to #5). Maria worked extremely close with her sister Kathleen to strategize and work on the custody case together.

After their mom died, these two sisters began an incestuous relationship, where they acted essentially as spouses, and really started working hard to get the fathers out of their childrens lives. This began with the two of them targeting Grant Centers. They would be at each other's hom nearly daily, and were extremely enmeshed. It was obvious to be as soon as I met these nasty sisters in late 2019.
