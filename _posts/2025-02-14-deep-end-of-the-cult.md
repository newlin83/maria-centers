At this time period, Maria lived in Idaho, was part of the cult, and her mother raised her woman Thomas. Mind you, Maria has never raised a child. In California, Hamid did everything. In Idaho, her mother did everything. So from 2008 to 2014, Maria not only sat at home unemployed, but wasn't even doing the bulk of childcare. That was left to Hamid and then her mother.
