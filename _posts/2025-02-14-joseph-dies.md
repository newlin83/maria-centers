title: Maria's First Child Joseph Volm Dies by Suicide (2023)

This is the child she gave up for adoption. He died by suicide August 6, 2023. I have no sympathy for Maria about this because Joseph should have been living with his father, except Maria didn't allow it. Or he should have stayed on the Navajo reservation. Sending him across the family with strangers likely led to his suicide. But of course it's all speculation and I don't know enough to really know what factors led to his death.
