Crime, living in meth house. Stealing cars. Running illegals and possibly drugs and money over the Arizona-Mexico border.

Numerous pregnancies and abortions. I know very little about this time in her life and she kept it hidden. I would guess that what happened in this time is so awful that it screwed her up for life. She probably knows if she told people her true story, nobody would want to be around her, knowing how screwed up she is.
