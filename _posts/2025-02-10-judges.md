From the moment I decided to file for divorce in March 2023, I was thrust into a legal system that seemed predetermined to strip me of my rights as a father. The judges, without even hearing the details of my case, operated under a set of assumptions that felt more like biases than principles of justice. Here’s what I quickly learned:

- **Your daughter belongs to your wife.**  
- **Your wife has complete control over visitation.** She doesn’t need to provide a reason to deny you access.  
- **If she doesn’t want you to see your child, you’ll have to spend every dollar and resource you have to fight for even minimal contact.**  
- **Fathers are primarily seen as financial providers.** Their emotional or physical presence in their children’s lives is treated as optional.  
- **The status quo favors mothers.** Any disruption to the child’s life with the mother is seen as unnecessary, even harmful.  
- **The mother’s behavior, background, or ability to parent is irrelevant.** No evidence you present will change that.  

This was the reality I faced from the very beginning, and it continued until Judge Stow signed the final order in November 2024. Throughout the process, the courts and lawyers seemed determined to place the blame on me, ignoring the actions of my ex-wife and the judges who enabled her.

# Judge Caldwell: Protective Orders as a Weapon

Before the divorce even began, my ex-wife had already set the stage to paint me in the worst possible light. She had been planning for the divorce and used every tactic to gain the upper hand. One of her most effective tools was Judge Caldwell, a judge known for handing out protective orders like candy.  

In my case, an argument between my ex-wife and me was enough for Judge Caldwell to issue a protective order and throw me out of my own home. There was no domestic violence, no drugs, no drinking—just a heated disagreement. My ex-wife claimed she felt “unsafe,” and that was all it took. The police showed up, and I was forced to leave my home.  

This was nothing more than a strategic move by my ex-wife. She had been setting the stage for months:  

- **She told our daughter’s pediatrician that I had been starving her by putting her on a vegan diet.** I only found out about this accusation a month before our family was scheduled to move.  
- **She created a plan for us to move cross-country, only to cancel it days before the move.**  

Of course, I was upset. Who wouldn’t be? But instead of addressing the issues, my ex-wife ran to Judge Caldwell, claimed she felt unsafe, and secured a protective order. The court didn’t care that there was no evidence of violence or threats. They didn’t care when she changed the locks on the house. Due process was nowhere to be found.  

# Judge Pittman: A System Stacked Against Fathers

After the protective order, the case moved to Judge Pittman. I was told he was one of the “better” judges, but my experience couldn’t have been further from that. Judge Pittman consistently ignored evidence and displayed clear bias against me. When I presented proof of severe neglect and child abuse by my ex-wife, he dismissed it outright, refusing to even hold a hearing. Yet, when my ex-wife made false accusations based on hearsay, Judge Pittman used them to grant her temporary sole custody.  

This broke me. In January 2024, I suffered a mental breakdown—a direct result of the relentless stress caused by my ex-wife’s manipulation, Judge Pittman’s rulings, and the attorneys involved. As soon as I struggled, my ex-wife filed a motion to remove all visitation rights, and Judge Pittman granted it. From January to August 2024, I was completely cut off from my daughter.  

It’s worth noting that I had never needed psychiatric help before this divorce. The system, designed to protect families, instead pushed me to the brink. Judge Pittman eventually removed himself from the case when he was promoted to District Judge. I can only hope others don’t have to endure the same biased treatment under his authority.  

# Judge Stow: A Facade of Calm, a Reality of Bias

After Judge Pittman’s departure, the case was reassigned to Judge Stow. His calm demeanor masked a deeply biased approach to my case. He imposed an oppressive and expensive visitation schedule, refusing to consider my circumstances while placing no burden on my ex-wife.  

At one point, I was in the process of finding a new attorney after firing my previous one during my mental breakdown. I filed a motion for an extension to secure representation, but Judge Stow denied it. At the hearing, he went further, ruling that I wouldn’t be allowed to submit any evidence at trial. This was a blatant denial of my due process rights.  

Despite having an attorney at trial and presenting evidence of my ex-wife’s neglect, abuse, and criminal behavior, Judge Stow refused to consider any of it. His final ruling in August 2024 was a devastating blow. He labeled me an “absent father” and accused me of interfering with medical appointments, parroting the lies and hearsay my ex-wife had presented.  

In the end, nothing had changed from the beginning of the case. I was left with the same oppressive visitation schedule my ex-wife had demanded from the start.  

# The Aftermath: A System That Failed My Daughter

My ex-wife and her sister have eight children between them, fathered by five different men. They’ve made it their mission to keep every single one of those fathers out of their children’s lives. These are two of the most manipulative, toxic individuals I’ve ever encountered, yet the court system handed them another child to raise.  

I had gathered extensive documentation of my ex-wife’s behavior, but it fell on deaf ears. The judges didn’t care. The system didn’t care. And now, my daughter is paying the price.  

## The Appeal I Couldn’t Afford

My attorney assured me I had a strong case for appeal. The rulings were riddled with legal errors and violations of my due process rights. But by the time the trial was over, I was financially drained. The deadline to appeal came and went, and I was left with no recourse.  

## Final Thoughts

This experience has left me disillusioned with the family court system. It’s a system that claims to prioritize the best interests of the child but often seems to prioritize maintaining the status quo, no matter how flawed or harmful it may be. Fathers are treated as second-class parents, and evidence of a mother’s misconduct is routinely ignored.  

To any father going through a similar battle, know that you’re not alone. The system is broken, but your love for your child matters. Keep fighting, even when it feels like the odds are stacked against you. And to those in positions of power within the legal system: it’s time to do better. Children deserve relationships with both parents, and fathers deserve to be more than just a paycheck.
