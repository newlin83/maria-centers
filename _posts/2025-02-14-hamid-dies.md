Maria vocally told me that she blames herself for Hamid death. She knows it's her fault and that her son will never have a relationship with his father. This caused her son to be violent. Had her son grown up with his father, Hamid would still be alive and Thomas wouldn't be violent. This is just par for the course with Maria's trail of destruction. 

Do I blame Maria for this? Absolutely. She kidnapped a child from a loving father. He was heartbroken and turned to drugs. Had Maria not kidnapped her son in 2011, Hamid would still be alive. This is what I mean by Maria causing a trail of misery. Maria repeatedly lied about the timeline of Hamids drug addiction and what actually happened. I don't believe a word Maria says. I think he turned to drugs after his son was ripped from his life.
