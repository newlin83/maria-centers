This is what I know about Maria Lynne Centers and the Centers family from my time around them from 2019 to 2023. I assume there's far more about her that would be damning, but I just don't know it. Especially those years of 2001 to 2011.

Marias life has been one of destroying lives and wealth. She's a complete ruinous force and anyone that's close to her gets hurt. She's manipulative, narcissistic, psychopathic, and superficially charming, so she's always able to get new people on her side. But as soon as someone close to her isnt doing what she wants, she treats them as disposable and does everything she can to destroy them. Even when people hear her story, she portrays herself constantly as the victim. The victim story is only believable to a point, and she can't comprehend that she has been the abuser for decades.

Maria needs help. She needs her freedoms heavily restrained. She shouldn't be allowed to raise kids or live with a boyfriend or get married.

But, this is very unlikely to happen. What will happen, is that she will continue to ruin the lives of those around her, and ruin herself. Her ner contribution to society is highly negative.

In a sane world, someone would've stepped in a long time ago. She would've been removed from her mother, which would've prevented the numerous pregnancies, drug addiction, and joining a cult. It would've stopped damage to all these children and the fathers who want to be with their kids.
