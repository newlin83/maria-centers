Maria was born 9/14/1983 in Shonto, Arizona. This was on the Navajo reservation. She was born to the most Bizarre and antisocial mother and person could have.

Lived with mother and sister. Mother was one of the most bizarre and weird people. And this isn't in a good way. I truly believe that it was the behavior of Maria's mother that screwed Maria up for the rest of her life. Here are some highlights:

- Maria's mom left her family in Massachusetts to travel the world. She ultimately ended up on the Navajo reservation in Arizona

- She joined a catholic cult while living in Arizona. This was CMRI, a cult widely known for physical and mental abuse.

- She was a foster parent. This kid ultimately ended up murdering someone and in jail. Not surprising, as he was raised by someone who has no business being a parent.

- Both Maria and her sister Kathleen Centers were teen moms. This says a lot about the kind of household they were living in.

- This woman bought into every scam, whether it was joining a cult, buying an MCM, wanting to know how to live without a social security card, buying silver online. People who act like this clearly have some kind of severe problem going on.
