At some point in the early 2010s, Maria, her sister Kathleen Centers, and mother Marilyn Centers decided to go hog wild, joining an extremist Catholic cult. Did they actually believe any of the religious teachings? Absolutely not!! They just used religion as a tool. These sisters became zealots, believing all kinds of wild stuff, wearing long jean skirts everywhere, buying into anti-Jewish conspiracies, refusing to participate in society. This was all a facade for power and control, and to present themselves to the world as these pious women. 

The whole thing was a sham.
