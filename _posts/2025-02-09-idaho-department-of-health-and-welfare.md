description: shielding child abusers and blaiming victims
---
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is totally corrupt, shields child abusers, and blames innocent people for child abuse. This has been my experience. The investigations they do aren't just a farce, it's as if they figure out who is doing the abuse, then claim they see nothing, and then blame the person who is trying to protect the children. I believe there is something much deeper going on, with connections between various organizations that are trying to protect women at all costs, including protecting abusive women and falsely blaming the fathers.

I was naive. I assumed that surely if the IDHW got involved, they would see the abuse my wife was doing, and would let everyone know. I assumed that what was happening during investigations would clearly be recorded. I assumed that they would talk to people who were familiar with the situation. I assumed they would review records. I soon learned, CPS is not there to protect children, but has instead has motives that have nothing to do with protecting children. The office is instead run by women who are out to child women who abuse children.

# Background

In 2022 my then wife was a stay at home mother who was supposed to be taking care of our 2-year-old daughter. Money was never an issue. Around this time things became concerning. My wife appeared to me to be incredibly depressed. More concerning, my wife began begging me to allow us to put our 2-year-old daughter up for adoption. She claimed to be an incapable parent (her words). I had to talk her down, telling her that children want to grow up with the people who know them best.

Some months passed by, and in December 2022, I began to become concerned about our daughter's weight. So I asked my wife to provide me with some medical records. She refused. This is when I really started to become concerned, because withholding medical records seemed bizarre. So, I demanded to take my daughter to a pediatrician for answers.

When I went to the pediatrician in February 2023, I was told not only that our daughter was severely malnourished and diagnosed as "failure to thrive", but that my ex-wife had blamed me for it, falsely claiming I had put our daughter on a vegan diet, claiming that this is why my daughter was malnourished. Neither I nor anyone in our family has ever been vegetarian or vegan. My wife later admitted in court that this accusation was entirely fabricated.

# My First Contact with IDHW in Feb 2023

I immediately became concerned that my wife was starving our daughter, and that I was being setup to be framed for her death. So I took action and demanded to be the one to feed our daughter until she gained weight. In the two weeks following, she gained weight faster than ever. I also called CPS, because I was deeply afraid of being setup as a child abuser and potential murderer if our daughter was to starve to death.

## IDHW First Investigation in Feb 2023

An agent from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare showed up. When they confronted my wife, she refused to talk. This should have been seen as bizarre for anyone. When the CPS agent took me outside, she told me that it was clear my wife had psychological problems. I agreed. She also told me that her older son said his mom had no rules for him at all and that he did whatever he wanted. I felt that the true story was being told here and that the agent was listening.

## IDHW Report in Feb 2023

Then their report came out. This was a completely different recording of events. Not only did they not mention that my wife had psychological problems, but they made no mention of the false accusations. On top of this, they made the accusation that I was OCD. This was shocking and bizarre. It was clear that someone else in their office were interfering with the investigation. My guess is that they took internal notes, and then created some other story entirely. Why they did this is a mystery. Maybe my wife has connections to these workers through her sister. Maybe they defend mothers at all cost. Whatever the reason, their report was nothing short of a hit piece.

# IDHW Second Investigation and Report in Oct 2023

Then things got much worse. I presented to the court the full scope of my ex-wife's child abuse and neglect. From this evidence, a judge ordered a new investigation into my wife. It was this investigation that was totally evil.

They did not investigation my wife at all. Rather, they put together a gigantic hit piece against me, full of false accusations, lies, and hearsay. They refused to speak with me as part of the investigation. They didn't look into any of the documentation I submitted, which clearly showed child abuse and neglect on her part. But to the IDHW, this was totally irrelevant. Instead, they filed a report with the court that was totally damning against me. The judge never let me defend myself. Instead, he concluded from the report alone, that it was me that was the problem, not my wife. There was no due process here, no chance for me to submit evidence, no chance to question any of these workers. 

## Lawsuit 

I filed a [lawsuit against the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/52812750/Newlin_v_Idaho_Department_of_Health_and_Welfare_et_al) in direct respose to the Oct 2023 report. Ultimately, I filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, because I was just not mentally and physically able to handle the sheer volume of documention they were filed, and I was afraid of having a mental breakdown in simply dealing with this case. This is going up against the state, and so I had no chance. I couldn't afford an attorney, but I doubt an attorney would even take on a case like this that's trying to hold the state accountable. These people are simply untouchable, and act with impunity.

# Naming Names

These are the names of the women who were involved with this report. The corruption is specifically with them in particular:

- Karyn Crone - she is the one who actually came to our home in Feb 2023.
- Nikki Stocking - she wrote the report in Feb 2023, all based on hearsay from Karyn who was actually present
- Worker Tanner - she made the 2nd visit in Oct 2023 and is especially corrupt. She should be fired and prosecuted immediately. This "Worker Tanner" won't even identify herself in the report. Furthermore, she didn't identify everyone she spoke with in the report. She also refused to speak with me when I called. This "Worker Tanner" should be in prison, what she's doing is incredibly corrupt and is destroying lives. I would only assume she's continuing in her corrupt practices.

It's bizarre that the person who visits the home doesn't actually write the report. It's clear that after an assessment, they talk things over, and then someone else writes a report. There's no audio recording of what actually happened that I'm aware of. They can literally write whatever they want, and it's held as gospel by the judges. They know they have positions of power where they're totally unaccountable. 

Trying to hold these people accountable is a waste of time. It absolutely falls on deaf ears with the state. They don't invesigate anything. They allow their workers to operate however they please, with no oversight. They should be required to wear bodycams when conducting these investigations so that false statements and accusations are clearly recorded. Everyone should have to identify themselves.

# Aftermath

There is no accountability for these women working at the Idoho Department of Health and Welfare. They will continue to defend child abusers and to write false reports against innocent fathers. Nothing is going to stop them. The state needs to shut down this office immediately and prosecute these women who are doing this.

# Final Thoughts

I believe there may be connections between IDHW and women's organizations locally, that seek to protect women who are child abusers. I think they want to blame men at all costs. There may be some exceptions to this where they simply can't get away with lying (e.g. active drug addiction), but if there's a way for them to lie, they will do it. I've heard that in North Idaho there is a lot of corruption among these women's groups, where abusive women actually join groups whose goal is to protect victims of abuse. So the people who absolutely should not be in these groups, are actually running them. And it seems there is no political will to break up and investigate these groups to root out corruption.
