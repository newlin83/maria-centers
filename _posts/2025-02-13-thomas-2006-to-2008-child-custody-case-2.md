While in rehab Maria got pregnant, for the umpteenth time. For whatever reason, instead of having yet another abortion, decided to keep him. Who knows why.

Maria was not married at the time. Was living in Arizona. Then was living in Louisiana. Her sister and mother have been highly mobile, moving around constantly. This is how they hide their past, by constantly making new friends and using whatever superficially charm they can drum up to get sympathy and present themselves as these nice religious women.

At some point, Maria's mother and sister found out Maria had been flying to California for sex. So the family said she had to move out. It was actually Maria's own mother and sister who said she had to go. They were fully embedded in cult behavior around this time.
