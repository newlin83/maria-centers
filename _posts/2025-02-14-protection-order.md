It was around February 2023 that I finally figured Maria out. I realized she's a complete scammer, hustler, narcissist, and manipulator. I realized I was living with this person. It was at this point that Maria decided to go on the offensive.

Maria had been planning to move our family to Boston, Massachusetts as of February 2023. Well, turned out that was nothing but a scam. She had never intended to leave Idaho.

On March 6, 2023, she casually told me that our family wasn't moving. This was after I had quit my job, gotten a new job, applied for liecensure, rented a moving truck, and made all moving plans. I was planning to leave in 2 weeks.

So yeah, I was mad at Maria. So what did she do? She ran to the courthouse and got a protection order. She claimed to the judge that she didn't feel safe.

This was a complete lie. Getting protection orders is a common tactic of narcissists, and she had planned this out. A common trick is to bait someone into an emotional response, and then claim you don't feel safe.

After Maria had been thrown out by police, I was never allowed back in. And on top of that, she used this as the entire basis of the custody case. She had me paying the mortgage for years, even though I wasn't allowed in. I wasn't allowed in to see my daughter.

Just to show you how nasty she is:

1. Maria said I could return to the condo if I agreed to have sex with her daily. Of course I said hell no, so she continued on her trail of destruction.

2. She dropped the protection order on the condition that I move to Boston. After I agreed to that in court, she asked me out for lunch and was very happy.

3. She changed locks on the house as soon as she was granted a protection order. This is illegal, but she didn't care. It was all about getting me out.

These nasty local North Idaho judges just gave Maria whatever she wanted. There was never a police report. There's never been domestic violence. I have no history of domestic violence. I've never laid a hand on someone in my life.
