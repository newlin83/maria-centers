# Kootenai Court Site

This site is based on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

# Prerequisites

1. Terminal is in VS Code for Windows.
2. I'm working in a Dev Container, so you'll need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
3. In VS Code, install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
4. You'll need [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm). I have both.
5. I use Cloudflare Pages. Their build environment uses Ruby 3.2.2. So that's what I'm using.

Install bundler:

```
gem install bundler
```

# Plugins and Images

1. I use the [jekyll-compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) plug-in to create new posts.
2. The avatar image is also from [clipartmax](https://www.clipartmax.com/middle/m2i8b1m2K9Z5m2K9_ant-clipart-childrens-ant-cute/).
3. The favicon is based on a [Google Fonts icon](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
