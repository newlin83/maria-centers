> My name is James Newlin, and I created this site.
{: .prompt-tip }

This website is a platform for me to share my personal experiences with the family court system in Kootenai County Idaho. It reflects my opinions and perspective on the harm I believe they caused me and my child. My goal is to raise awareness and seek accountability, not to defame or harm anyone.

These are the other related sites I've created:

[CMRI & Tridentine Latin Rite Church](https://www.tridentines.com/). This is a cult that was setup in Coeur d'Alene in the 1960s. The leader of the group, Francis Schuckardt, would travel the country and convince women to leave their husbands, and abscond with their children and bring them to Kootenai County. The cult would shield these children from their fathers. The courts in Kootenai County defended the cult.

[Lakeside Pediatrics](https://www.lakesidepediatrics.net/). This is a corrupt medical office. Kayla Ellis, a social worker in their office, covered up for the known child abuse and neglect of my ex-wife, and instead spread the lies that it was in fact me abusing our daughter. They knew this was all a lie. Ultimately, I lost all medical decision making ability over my daughter directly because of their defamatory statements during a court ordered investigation. I believe they did this because they take a "defend the mother at all costs" mentality, so when an abusive mother is being confronted by the father, they lie to cover up the abuse and to frame the father for it.
